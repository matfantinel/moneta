# No Longer Maintained

Unfortunately, I am not able to work on Moneta anymore. It was a fun side project but I no longer use Linux and don't have the time to make sure it keeps working correctly.

If you or someone you know wants to keep the project going, feel free to fork and/or let me know so I can move the ownership of this repo to you (if that's possible). I can also check with the elementary AppCenter/FlatHub if it's possible to change ownership of an existing app.

Moneta is a handy applet that stays on your desktop and updates the exchange rate of currencies of your choice. It is a fork from the app [Coin](https://github.com/lainsce/coin/) by @lainsce, just adapted to handle real-world currencies instead of virtual ones.

Most of the code and design is copied/based on his. So if you like this, consider sponsoring him on GitHub!

## Built for elementary OS

While Moneta can run in any Linux distribution, it was built with [elementary OS] in mind. It runs perfectly on other distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. though. Download it on Flathub if you want to use Moneta everywhere!

## Translating

You can help translating this app with the following steps:

* Add the language you want to translate to in the `po/LINGUAS` file (if it's already there, you can skip this step);
* Then, make sure the translation files are updated:
```shell
cd build
ninja com.github.matfantinel.moneta-pot
ninja com.github.matfantinel.moneta-update-po
```
* Then, update your language file in `po` folder with your translations. For example, portuguese (pt) translation file is `po/pt.po`;
* Some additional translation files can be found in `po/extra/` (stuff for the xml and .desktop files)
* You might want to update these files as well:
  
  ```shell
  # we're still in ./build
  ninja extra-pot
  ninja extra-update-po
  ```
* Fork this repo, commit to your repo and then open a Pull Request to this one.

## Developing and building

If you want to go ahead and compile Moneta yourself, you'll need the following dependencies:

* libgranite-dev
* libgtk-3-dev
* meson
* valac
* libsoup2.4-dev
* libjson-glib-dev

You can install them on elementary OS Odin with:

```shell
sudo apt install elementary-sdk
```

And on other Ubuntu-based distributions with:

```shell
sudo apt install libgranite-dev libgtk-3-dev meson valac libsoup2.4-dev libjson-glib-dev
```

Run `meson build` to configure the build environment and run `ninja install`
to install:

```shell
meson build --prefix=/usr
cd build
sudo ninja install
```

Then run it with:

```shell
com.github.matfantinel.moneta
```

## Flatpak

Moneta is also available as a Flatpak. To build/install it locally, first you have to install the necessary runtimes:

```shell
sudo apt install flatpak-builder
flatpak install io.elementary.Sdk/x86_64/6
```

Then, from the project root:

```shell
flatpak-builder --install repo com.github.matfantinel.moneta.json --force-clean --user --install
```

The app should be displayed on your apps list, or you can run it with:
```shell
flatpak run com.github.matfantinel.moneta
```
